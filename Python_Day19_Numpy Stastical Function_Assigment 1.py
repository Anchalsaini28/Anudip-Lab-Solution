# 1.Compute the median of the flattened NumPy array 

# Input: x_odd = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])

# Step 1: Import NumPy library, which is essential for numerical operations in Python
import numpy as np

# Step 2: Create a NumPy array with an odd number of elements
# In this case, we are using an array with 7 elements
x_odd = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])

# Step 3: Flatten the array using the flatten() method
# Flattening an array converts it into a 1D array, but since the array is already 1D,
# this operation is redundant here. However, it is necessary for multidimensional arrays.
flattened_array = x_odd.flatten()

# Step 4: Compute the median of the flattened array
# The median is the middle value of a sorted array, or the average of the two middle values
# if the array has an even number of elements. Since this is an odd-length array,
# the median will be the middle element.
median_value = np.median(flattened_array)

# Step 5: Output the median value
print("Median of the array:", median_value)

# Output:-

"""
Median of the array: 4.0
