# Step 1: Declare the function 'div' with two parameters 'a' and 'b'
def div(a, b):
    # Step 2: Perform the division and store the result in 'result'
    result = a / b
    # Step 3: Print the result
    print("The division of", a, "by", b, "is:", result)

# Step 4: Call the 'div' function and pass two numbers as arguments
div(20, 2)  # Here, 10 is divided by 2, and the result will be displayed

# Answer:- The division of 20 by 2 is: 10.0
